/*  A simple C skip list implementation mapping string keys to string values.
 *
 *  Designed with simplicity and minimalism in mind, this implementation uses
 *  fixed-size pillar arrays.
 *
 *  I wrote this because skip lists are my favorite data structure. They are
 *  relatively easy to write and understand (in contrast with certain types of
 *  self-balancing binary trees), use no "magic" hash functions, and still
 *  manage to provide expected O(log n) insertion, search, and deletion.

// This defines the maximum number of next pointers that can be stored in a

// lg(N), where:
//      lg() is the base-2 logarithm function
//      N is the maximum number of entries in your list
//  If you set this to 1, you will get a slightly slower sorted linked list 
//  implementation.
